# Addon: Custom Snoo

The Snoo is Reddit's alien mascotte. He's in the top-left! With this addon you can replace the Snoo with and image of your choice. 

Some notes:

* **The image should be 42px by 42px!**
* Make it clear for the user that clicking that image leads them back to Reddit's homepage. This can be done by editing the original Snoo so that is is dressed up in clothing related to the topic of the subreddit. For example, a painting subreddit might have a Snoo wearing a smock and holding a paintbrush. This makes is clear that clicking on the Snoo will lead back to Reddit's homepage, but still adds an art-themed touch to it.
